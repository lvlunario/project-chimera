# Prototype delivery baseline — September 12 to December 12, 2026

All dates use Asia/Manila. Target dates are a managed baseline, not a guarantee.
Baseline version 1: September 12. September 22 update: P0 is approved by explicit
delegation; P1/P2 are conditionally accepted for continued development under the
[decision record](reviews/2026-09-22-delegated-decisions.md). Personal walkthroughs
remain unperformed. Original dates below are unchanged; M0's scope decision was recorded
September 22, three days after its September 19 target. Downstream forecasts
remain October 3/17, November 7/28 and December 12 with no baseline movement.

## Status update — October 29, 2026

The October 17 M2 baseline was missed by twelve days. The engineering vertical, eight-control
P3/P4 candidate and exact-commit P3/P4/P5 acceptance-preparation packet are implemented, but
no gate disposition or Leo walkthrough has been recorded. This is a schedule slip, not a
change to the original baseline.

M3 November 7 is **amber** with 9 calendar days remaining: automated Chromium and the exact
candidate are green, and the dated packet is ready. Recovery is now to freeze features, run
the operator worksheet, record actual manual-device/screen-reader/Leo observations,
disposition defects and use remaining
time for release preparation. P7 release preparation includes a fixed versioned synthetic
performance workload verified locally and on the exact published Python 3.11/3.12 candidate,
plus a versioned local-prototype threat model and exact-candidate assessment implemented and
independently reviewed. The hosted threat assessment is green. An exact-candidate readiness
inventory now covers 116/116 declared requirements, both open fixed/verified defect issues,
zero declared release blockers, and six operator/release guides with 47 required headings.
It prepares review inputs but does not grant M4/M5 or human acceptance. The exact M4 packet,
evidence bundle and acceptance script remain open. November 28 and December 12 remain
achievable on that basis;
automation still cannot substitute for human acceptance.

## Operational problem and proposed scope
An integration engineer needs to verify a communications test run, identify failing
requirements, and hand another engineer reproducible evidence rather than screenshots.

Prototype demonstration:
1. Import a timestamped link-margin CSV using a documented schema and units.
2. Select requirements and run checks; view pass, fail, blocked and missing-evidence states.
3. Save and reopen the run, inspect the failing samples, and export a traceable report.
4. Repeat with a passing fixture and a malformed input; show correct outcomes for each.

Use synthetic fixtures first. The file adapter must also accept user-supplied measured
data conforming to the schema. Real-data validation remains pending until a suitable,
authorized dataset exists; no claims of hardware validation based on synthetic runs.
No live radio control, distributed worker fleet, enterprise tenancy or certification
in the three-month prototype. AI summaries are optional and cannot change verdicts.

## Milestones and acceptance
| Gate | Deadline | Engineering deliverable | Leo's participation |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 / P0 | Sep 19 | Target user, three use cases, demo script, exclusions and risks documented | Review concept and adjust priorities |
| M1 / P1 | Oct 3 | Versioned evidence, CLI, installable package, CI; requirements/interface baseline | Explain workflow/failure semantics; review evidence |
| M2 / P2–P3 | Oct 17 | Vertical slice: CSV to check to persisted/reopened result; restart behavior tested | Observe pass/fail demo; challenge assumptions |
| M3 / P3–P5 | Nov 7 | Prototype features complete: telemetry validation, requirement mapping, reports and basic operator dashboard | Try operator journey and record defects |
| M4 / P7 | Nov 28 | Release candidate: clean install, integrated regression, critical requirements verified | Review readiness, limitations and acceptance script |
| M5 / P7 | Dec 12 | Tagged prototype, operator/developer manuals, evidence bundle and demonstrated acceptance | Run or observe acceptance and record disposition |

Nov 29–Dec 12 is reserved for defect correction, documentation, and acceptance.
New features in that interval need a stated impact and Leo's decision.
P6 AI assistance starts only when critical prototype work is on track; it is not
a release gate. Phase overlap allows documentation/UI design during core work,
but dependent integrations use agreed interfaces.

## Tracking rules
Each work issue includes requirement IDs, deliverable, role owner, target date,
dependencies and verification method. Track engineering state separately from
PM acceptance: planned / in progress / implemented / verified / reviewed / accepted.
Only evidence moves engineering state; acceptance requires Leo's actual response or an
evidence-backed decision within his explicit delegation. Silence is never acceptance.
The September 22 delegation does not waive tests, validation conditions or final acceptance.

Report green when the next gate is achievable with current evidence and known work;
amber when an unresolved dependency or scope threatens it; red when forecast exceeds
the gate date or a release blocker prevents it. Show original deadline, forecast,
cause and recovery options. Do not move the baseline date silently.

## Phase approval instructions

Use the [phase approval guide](APPROVALS.md) for P0–P7 verification and validation checklists,
required evidence, walkthroughs, expected results and decision records.
Each phase packet must include these checks and candidate-specific runnable instructions.
Engineering verification and Leo's acceptance are tracked separately; no phase is
accepted from silence or from a test count alone.
